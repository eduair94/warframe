# Void Ledger: organic growth and content maintenance

## Objective and operating loop

Grow useful organic traffic and repeat use by solving real Warframe questions with accurate guides
and working market tools. A daily Codex thread review is scheduled for 10:00 America/Montevideo.
The existing quarterly GitHub guide refresh remains enabled; check its recent runs before repeating
its work. Read `CLAUDE.md` and `docs/repo-map.md` before changing the app.

Each run should select and finish a concrete improvement, record its evidence and verify the result.
Always end each iteration with a full production deploy, including API, frontend and live feed,
as explicitly requested by the user. Commit the final documentation before deploying, wait for
the complete workflow to succeed and verify production. Do not finish with an undeployed or
`[skip ci]` commit. Use manual workflow dispatch on `main` when a full redeploy needs no code change.
Prioritize availability, false information and broken indexable pages first. Use official
[Warframe patch notes](https://www.warframe.com/en/patch-notes) and
[news](https://www.warframe.com/en/news) for changing game facts; distinguish announcements from
released changes. Review the actual affected guidance before changing its review date.

When GA4 or Search Console is accessible, compare complete 7-day and 28-day periods using organic
sessions, clicks, impressions, CTR, landing pages, queries, country and language. Also inspect useful
actions (`market_open`, guide-to-tool navigation, watchlists) and retention. Missing access or missing
data is not zero traffic. Do not claim that a deployment caused growth from a short before/after window.
Keep raw private analytics exports under ignored `tmp/`, outside version control.

## 2026-09-14 — first maintenance iteration

### Verified baseline and fixes

- The dynamic sitemap confused `set: true` (membership in a set) with an assembled set. The live
  catalogue contained 1,033 flagged items but only 238 assembled sets. This advertised 795 invalid set
  URLs per locale (10,335 across 13 locales). Require names ending in ` Set` (a substring also matched
  Motus Setup and Grineer Settlement scenes), deduplicate slugs and retain relic and mission URLs.
- Spanish sitemap lacked 53 localized tool detail pages. Explicit dynamic tool URLs now request the
  sitemap module's locale transformation.
- Unknown relics/missions returned HTTP 200. Entity pages now distinguish an authoritative absence
  (404) from a temporary data failure (503), preserving useful page error/retry states.
- Sitemap source reads could outlive the sitemap module's five-second budget and a catalogue failure
  removed mission discovery too. Fetch independently and concurrently, use bounded timeouts and small
  recent URL snapshots, and return 503 on a complete cold outage.
- Live JSON-LD included localhost identifiers on cached pages despite correct canonicals. Structured
  data should use the configured public frontend origin, never the API or an internal render host.
- A live guide emitted 282 speculative script prefetch links. Remove only these internal script hints
  from SSR HTML; retain render-critical preloads/styles and hover/focus navigation prefetching.
- The production build precached 492 files (19,837 KiB) on service-worker installation, including
  unused route and locale chunks. Restrict install-time caching to core icons and cache requested
  hashed assets with bounded runtime storage. Preserve API caching and push notification handling.
  Workbox generation against the same build reduced this from 20,314,873 bytes to 61,870 bytes
  (9 files, about 60 KiB), a 99.7% reduction in precache content. These are uncompressed file sizes,
  not a measurement of every visitor's network transfer or loading time.
- Analytics deferred initialization needed Nuxt context. Preserve early buffered events and replace
  the homemade Core Web Vitals approximation with Google's
  [measurement library](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/web-vitals), including CLS precision,
  metric IDs/deltas and navigation attribution. This improves measurement; it is not evidence of
  measured traffic growth. See `docs/analytics.md`.
- The mastery guide's failed-test cooldown and rank-40 mastery advice were outdated. Review and
  propagate the factual corrections across its localized snapshots; cite the official sources in
  the guide itself. Guide edits must not rewrite publication dates, and internal prose links should
  keep readers in their selected language.
- Quarterly refresh could not parse two valid TypeScript guides, treated video provider failures as
  missing videos and encouraged date-only updates. Parse data safely, validate all outputs before
  writing, reject ungrounded generations, bound external calls and preserve dates on no-op edits.

### Verification and release

All 548 API/technical SEO unit tests passed, as did 10 guide refresh tests, 21 frontend tests
(analytics, resource hints, localized rich text and generated PWA caching), the i18n compile gate and
repo-map check. The initial production build and 12-route built SSR smoke checks passed. The latter
confirmed 200/404/503 semantics, canonical origins, no localhost in JSON-LD and zero speculative script
prefetch tags with required preloads preserved. The final source predicates, translations and PWA
configuration additionally passed focused checks. Full app typecheck reports project-wide errors; no diagnostic
references the new analytics, sitemap, entity-status or resource-hint implementation. It remains
advisory under the repo's established policy. Local diagnostic logs are ignored `*.log` files.
GA4/Search Console baseline access was attempted through Supermetrics. Both discovery calls failed
with an invalid OAuth grant requiring reauthentication, before any property data was retrieved.
The 7/28-day traffic baseline is unavailable, not zero. No login, permission changes or private
analytics export occurred. Continue content/technical work while this access issue remains unresolved.

Release `8dac1a7` passed CI and deployed successfully in
[run 34806486463](https://github.com/eduair94/warframe/actions/runs/34806486463).
Public checks of 11 routes confirmed the expected 200/404 responses, canonical/schema origins,
localized links and zero speculative script prefetch tags. English and Spanish sitemaps each
contained 238 valid set URLs and 54 tool URLs, with the false-positive set names absent. The
Spanish mastery guide displayed the corrected 23-hour rule and September review date, and its
localized link opened the working flip tool without browser console errors.

Production verification caught an additional delivery issue: Cloudflare's ordinary `/sw.js`
response still held the old September 2 worker, while an uncached request returned the deployed
9-entry worker. Disabling Nitro caching had not set an HTTP cache-control header. A follow-up
migrates registration once to `/sw-v2.js`, keeps the existing root scope and push integration,
and sends `Cache-Control: no-store` for both worker paths and the web manifest. Registration is
imported into hashed client JavaScript, avoiding another stable cached registration script.
Focused tests generate the actual Vite registration and Workbox worker to verify these properties.
The follow-up `7ce7d86` passed all blocking checks and deployed successfully in
[run 34807390159](https://github.com/eduair94/warframe/actions/runs/34807390159).
Two ordinary public requests to `/sw-v2.js` returned HTTP 200, `Cache-Control: no-store`
and Cloudflare `BYPASS`; both served the 1,873-byte worker with 9 precache entries and no
`/_nuxt` JavaScript in that list. The production build reported 58.83 KiB of precache content.
The current hashed entry `/_nuxt/Cxyp1hyo.js` registers `/sw-v2.js` with scope `/`.
The manifest also returned HTTP 200 with `no-store` and Cloudflare `DYNAMIC`.
The public Spanish guide loaded correctly again after this deployment. CI reconfirmed
548 API tests, 10 guide tests, 21 frontend tests, i18n compilation and the repo-map check.

### Next priorities

Time-sensitive editorial queue verified against official announcements on 2026-09-14:

- **Plague Star is active:** update `/guides/forma` with participation requirements, contract tiers
  and current rewards. The [2026 announcement](https://www.warframe.com/en/news/operation-plague-star-2026)
  (September 9) lists an end date of September 23 at 10:00 ET and a built Umbra Forma offering.
  Verify current prices and limits before including them. This deserves the next content pass.
- **Citrine Prime is announced for September 23:** the [September 4 announcement](https://www.warframe.com/en/news/citrine-prime-access)
  includes Steflos and Corufell Prime. Prepare relevant relic guidance, but publish actual relic IDs,
  drop locations and probabilities only once official tables support their availability.
- **Riven changes are announced for Iceblade of Narin:** the [September 8 Devstream 197 recap](https://www.warframe.com/en/news/devstream-197-overview)
  discusses combining Rivens and locking stats. Revisit the guide and value estimator when release
  notes establish the final costs/restrictions. The official PC index still showed
  [Hotfix 43.5.4](https://www.warframe.com/en/patch-notes/pc/43-5-4) during this review.

Ongoing priorities:

1. Establish actual GA4/Search Console baselines if the account/property is accessible. Select search
   opportunities from impressions, intent and useful actions; do not invent keyword volumes.
2. Audit the remaining 24 guides against current official updates, starting with progression,
   Duviri/Circuit rotations, resources and platinum/relic farming. Reconcile localized snapshots.
   Known content candidates: `mods.ts` groups Slash with Toxin as bypassing shields and describes
   Rolling Guard as resetting shield gates; `relics.ts` confuses rewards per mission/rotation and
   relic sources with Fissure opening locations. Verify mechanics against authoritative sources
   before correcting all language versions. `builds` and `forma` still lack translated snapshots.
3. Add timely original guidance only when there is a clear player question and verified answer.
   Connect guides to relevant live tools, show data age/limitations and avoid fixed live prices.
4. Check real mobile LCP/INP/CLS after enough post-release samples. Investigate bottlenecks with
   measurements; do not label lab or homemade metrics as CrUX field results.
5. Sample indexable sitemaps, canonicals, hreflang, response status and structured-data origins after
   each routing/content release. Google advises sitemaps list desired canonical URLs and use truthful
   modification dates: [sitemap guidance](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/sitemaps/build-sitemap).
6. Make deployment atomic before increasing deployment frequency: the current SSH workflow builds
   in the active directory, and Nitro clears `.output` before PM2 reloads the old process. Build in
   separate release directories, switch only after validation and retain the previous release.
   Verify old and new HTML asset requests and a failed build; the current HTTP-200 home-page check
   alone cannot catch assets disappearing during a build.

Traffic improvement has not yet been measured in this iteration. Search engines decide crawling,
indexing and ranking; a passing technical check does not guarantee placement or a traffic increase.
